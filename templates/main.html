        <h1> WordCloud</h1>
        <div class="text-proj">

          <p>A word cloud is a visual representation of text data, where the size of each word represents its
            frequency or
            importance in the data. It is often used as a tool for exploratory data analysis, text mining, and data
            visualization.</p> <br>
          <p>Word clouds are generated by first extracting the text data from a source, such as a document, a website,
            or
            a social media feed. The text is then cleaned, processed, and analyzed to identify the most frequent words
            and
            their associated weights or scores. These words are then plotted in a graphical format, where the size and
            color of each word reflect its frequency or weight.</p> <br>
          <p>Word clouds can be used for various purposes, such as:</p>

          <div class="list">
            <p><b>1.</b> Summarizing text data: A word cloud can quickly give an overview of the most important words
              in a piece
              of text, such as a document, a report, or a survey response.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>2.</b> Identifying themes and patterns: A word cloud can help identify the recurring themes and
              topics in a
              large corpus of text, such as a collection of news articles or customer reviews.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>3.</b> Visualizing sentiment and emotions: A word cloud can reveal the most common positive and
              negative words
              in a piece of text, such as social media posts or customer feedback, to understand the overall sentiment
              or emotions of the audience.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>4.</b>
              Enhancing presentations and reports: A word cloud can be used as a visual aid to convey complex
              information and data in a more engaging and memorable way, such as in presentations or reports.</p>
          </div><br>
          <p>Overall, the significance of word clouds lies in their ability to provide a quick and intuitive
            understanding
            of text data, which can be used to inform decision-making, gain insights, and communicate effectively with
            different stakeholders.</p>

        <h1 class="item-heading">Covid Prediction</h1>
        <div class="text-proj">
          <p>The short-term COVID-19 prediction model project involves fetching and organizing the daily COVID-19
            cases data
            for India using the Pandas library. The project fetches the data from the CSSEGISandData repository and
            stores it
            in a tidy format in a CSV file named "India.csv". <br>
            The <code>loadData</code> function is used to convert the raw
            data into a tidy format for confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases. The <code>refreshData</code>
            function
            merges the three dataframes, keeps only the data for India, and adds a new column named "Day" representing
            the
            number of days since the first case was reported in India.</p> <br>
          <p>The organized data can be used to develop a short-term prediction model using linear regression. By using
            the
            "Day" column as the independent variable and the "CumConfirmed" column as the dependent variable, the
            model can
            predict the number of COVID-19 cases for upcoming days. <br> However, it's important to keep in mind that
            the
            accuracy of the model may be impacted by changes in testing protocols, vaccination rates, and government
            policies. <br><br> Overall, this project offers a useful tool for analyzing COVID-19 cases data and
            developing predictive
            models for India.</p>

          <p>

            The project aims to develop a Django-based automatic text summarization model using deep learning algorithms
            such as RNN and LSTM to output one or two-sentence summaries for a given article with high accuracy. The
            project begins by importing necessary libraries and preprocessing the news summary dataset by converting all
            columns to string data type and cleaning the text by removing punctuations, stop words, hyphens, white
            spaces, and new lines. <br><br>
            The text is then tokenized and padded to create input and target sequences
            for the model, which is defined using an encoder-decoder architecture with attention. The encoder takes the input
            sequence and returns the final encoder state, which is passed to the decoder along with the target sequence.
            <br><br>
            The decoder uses the encoder state and attention mechanism to generate the output sequence. The project is
            deployed using Django, and the news summary is displayed in the web application. The project is designed to
            procure real-time articles from reputable news portals, and the complete text is loaded onto a CSV file on
            the backend, along with accompanying images, headlines, dates, times, full article text, and "Read More"
            URLs. <br> <br> These data are then transmitted to the website, where they are processed using a
            Bi-Directional LSTM text summarization model and displayed to the user interface in the form of news
            summaries. The project has a frontend filter component that allows users to select and read news exclusively
            from their preferred news portals.
